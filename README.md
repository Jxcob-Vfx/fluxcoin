# Fluxcoin
Fluxcoin is an experimental python based blockchain that allows users to write transactions and pass strings to a running, public ledger. This ledger is visible to all users of the blockchain, and cannot be modified except by approved admin users. This code is experimental and is not meant to be interpreted as a serious piece of blockchain technology. Instead, it should be examined as a proof of concept for a friendly, human-readable, accessible blockchain ledger.
